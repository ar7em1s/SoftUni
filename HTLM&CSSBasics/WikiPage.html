    <p>
      The <b>brown bear <i>(Ursus arctos)</i></b> is a large bear species found across Eurasia and North America. In North America, the populations of brown bears are called grizzly bears, while the subspecies that inhabits the Kodiak Islands of Alaska is known as the Kodiak bear. It is one of the largest living terrestrial members of the order Carnivora, rivaled in size only by its closest relative, the polar bear <i>(Ursus maritimus)</i>, which is much less variable in size and slightly bigger on average.
